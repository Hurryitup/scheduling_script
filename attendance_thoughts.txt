Needs:

See all tour guides expected on a day, organized by slot
Ability to track attendance/report on it whenever necessary, by guide and by slot
Ability to manage switches - One guide covering for another on a specific day


Python server side
- picks up config information from csvs in the directory
        - slot names
        - tour guide names and their slots
        - tour guide slots must match slot names

- how it would work:
        - figure out which day it is
        - pick up which tour guides are supposed to show up for that day
        - each tour guide would have a "came, gave, did not come" button next to them
        - whenever "submit" is clicked on a slot/day, add to two files - one for the tg specific attendance,
        one for the day/slot wise attendance.

- what the attendance csv would look like (columns)
        - name
        -
